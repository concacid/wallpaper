Reddit Wallpaper
=================

A simple script to get the newest posts from a subreddit (i.e.: http://www.reddit.com/r/<subreddit>),
get image links and return the links.

From crude testing this supports initially i.imgur.com and imgur.com links (but **not** albums!).

There is no license, I express no warranty of any kind and if this blows up your computer then I will donate a cookie to your fund.

But, really, this was just made in fun.  Simply run the script and pass the subreddit you want to fetch images from as an argument.

Enjoy!
